<p class="no-indent">Reader, have you ever visited the
western Highlands of Argyleshire?
If you have, you will doubtless retain
many a pleasant memory of the
wild glens and the fair lakes, and
the picturesque and magnificent
mountains that make up the lovely
scenery of these regions of the beautiful.
If you have not, trust yourself
for a few brief minutes to our guidance,
while we strive to recal the
impressions of one day, out of many
happy days, passed in a Highland
village there, not very long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>The traveller who visits this spot,
seldom leaves it without exploring
the upper shores and the Serpent’s
Fall, at the head of Loch ——, nor
did I and my companion; and, as
we were slowly rowed up it against
the tide, we gazed in admiration
at the pyramidal and craggy mountains
that towered majestically above
the deep blue waters of the lake,
shelving into them, and jutting out
in little promontories that almost
met on either side, damming up the
current so as to make it discharge
itself with tenfold impetuosity as it
escaped from the narrowed channel.
One of our guides was a student
of St. Andrew’s, the son of one of
the smaller tenantry on the Lochiel
estates, and, during the vacation, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
was endeavouring, by rowing visitors
about the lake, to raise a small
sum of money for the purchase of
books to enable him to pursue his
studies on his return to college. He
was a fine athletic-looking lad, with
a countenance of remarkable intelligence,
and was perfectly well versed
in all the legends of the locality.
Indeed, his older and more staid
fellow-labourer at the oar now and
then allowed a half incredulous
smile to steal over his weather-beaten
face, as Mr. —— related
how the shepherd of the glen, in
ages past, had, after many warnings,
been changed into a mountain on
the Inverness side (where, alas! he
was wont to stray), and how his
faithful wife, who had many a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
strained her eyes in vain in watching
for his return, was rewarded for
her fidelity and devotion, by finding
herself and the stone, on which she
used to sit in the dim twilight,
gradually growing into the shapely
mountain that still bears her name,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
so that, while the world lasts, she
shall never again lose sight of her
gude man. It was truly an idle
tale, and yet not, perhaps, altogether
vain, for it might suggest a thought
of sin and sorrow, that pair inseparably
united by a decree which
none may break. But we must not
linger thus, lest minutes turn to
hours, and patience be tired before
her time.</p>

<p>After many a vigorous stroke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and many a long pull, that caused
the beads of dew to stand thick
upon the brows of our almost-exhausted
boatmen, who with all their
efforts could scarcely keep their
course among the eddies of opposing
currents, we at length saw the water
of the fall, flowing into the lake,
and gazing on it in admiration, like
a silver line upon a field of ultramarine,
soon after landed.</p>

<p>I will not stop to tell of sketching
and climbing, and of boggy swamps
that threatened to impede our way
to the most desirable points of view.
I will only say that we were thoroughly
exhausted with fatigue and
hunger, when, after some hours
spent in exploring, we turned our
steps towards a “house of refreshment”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
which our boatmen had
pointed out. They had promised to
announce our approach, and accordingly
we found the table spread with
freshly-made oat-cake, still hot and
crisp, a large bowl of rich cream,
fresh butter, a bottle of whisky, and
a drinking-horn.</p>

<p>The “house of refreshment” was,
however, nothing more than a rough
Highland hut, situated at the foot
of the old road up the glen, if road
that could be called which was
formed of a succession of vast ledges
of rock from three to five feet high;
such as it is, it is the only opening
among the mountains that, bare and
rugged, rise abruptly on all sides,
and it is bordered by a narrow track,
down which the drovers still conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
their flocks and herds, unless
when it is flooded by the mountain
torrents, that rush thundering
through the glen, and discharge
themselves through a chasm in the
rock to the left of the hut, forming
one of the small streams that feed
the lake. A huge, shapeless mass
of rock rises just opposite this rustic
shelter, and must serve to break the
violence of the blasts that sweep
the glen, though it also hides the
romantic beauties of its entrance.</p>

<p>A little group of three or four
children were clambering over the
rocks, and dragging huge branches
of the bracken, which they had been
out to get, as litter for the favourite
cow that stood in a byre or shed at
one end of the hut. At the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of their ringing laughter as they
drew near, a rough, wiry-headed
tabby cat, that had been basking in
the sun, put up her back, and after
leisurely stretching herself and pawing,
walked to meet the merry ones,
and purred and rubbed herself
against each in turn, turning up her
green eyes as if she expected a caress
in answer to her greeting. The
bracken was dragged to the cow-shed,
and then with a yell of self-gratulation,
or of hunger, we cannot
precisely say which, the whole number
rushed into the room we occupied,
and as suddenly disappeared
through a side door.</p>

<p>Our meal despatched, and neither
waiter nor hostess appearing, we
had leisure to survey the apartment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
The centre was supported on what
was literally a roof <em>tree</em>, for a venerable
beech, that had, perhaps, been
the original attraction to the site,
still upheld the simple framework
of the roof, raised aloft on its
double-twisted stem, selected, doubtless,
for its promise of double
strength. In one corner of the
room stood a solid oaken chest, the
receptacle of the meal that supplied
the family with food; opposite was
a bed, or rather shake-down, for it
was on the floor, but looked very
clean and comfortable; on the third
side the peat was giving out its red
heat from a spacious hearth, and
indeed induced such a feeling of suffocation,
that we would fain have
opened the window for a little fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
air from the mountains. The massive
framework, however, was not
made to open; it seemed calculated
rather to exclude light as well as
air, for the proportion of glass was
small indeed; so in despair I went to
the side door, and, in opening it,
nearly tumbled through, for the
earth (there was no flooring) had
sunk so much at the threshold as to
have left a sort of trench. I recovered
myself and stepped over, and
there were the four barefooted
urchins with their curly heads and
their rosy cheeks, the very picture
of health and glee, standing round
a three-legged stool on which their
mother had set a large bowl of
smoking potatoes and milk. They
were sipping and eating, and just as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
entered the room, the elder boy having
fished up a particularly attractive,
flowery bit of potato between his
finger and thumb, ran to the baby,
a fine child of some ten or eleven
months old, who was sitting on its
mother’s knee, and began to cram
its tiny mouth with the delicious
morsel which broke and crumbled
and fell into the infant’s lap; the
petted baby smiled and laughed, and
helped to pick up the crumbs, and
put them, not into her own mouth,
but her mother’s. “That’s a braw
bairn,” exclaimed the mother, “a
right Highland lassie, aye to gie the
bit and sup afore you tak’ it yoursel;”
and the child, at the sound of
its mother’s voice, turned to her,
and forgot the potato and nestled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
her bosom, and she bent her head
over the bonnie wee thing, and gave
it a long fond kiss, as though it had
been her first-born. She was seated
on a low oaken bench, such as in
England is called a settle, and a
high screen behind her prevented
her seeing our entrance.</p>

<p>We stood for a moment looking
on the scene of simple domestic happiness
before us, and then introducing
ourselves by a few words of
greeting to the group around the
bowl, we thanked the hostess for
our seasonable refreshment, and
asked what we should pay. “Oh,
naething, just naething,” was the
reply; “ye’re wanderers and far frae
hame, and ye’re welcome.” We
remonstrated. She shook her head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
saying, “God has gi’en us plenty,
and he bids us use hospitality, and
ye winna gainsay his bidding, so just
gang in peace,” she added, laughing
goodhumouredly, “for ye’re far frae
——, I guess, and ye’ll hae a long
pull hame.”</p>

<p>It was indeed getting late, and the
thought of four hours on the lake in
the dark, had a hurrying tendency,
so pointing to the Bible and hymn-book
on the shelf above the children’s
bed, we bade her remember
us in their evening worship, and,
slipping some silver into the children’s
hands, we took our leave.
We had not gone many yards before
we met a Highlander with a net at
his back, and a basket of fish before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
him, and the shout of delight which
in another moment burst from the
cot, proved him to be, as we had
supposed, the father of the group
within. Before we had gone far,
we heard a sonorous voice raising
the evening hymn, and anon the
sound of shrill and infant voices
mingling with it. We could not
stop to listen, but we joined in heart,
and as a fresh breeze from the
mountain pass brought the sweet
sounds once more to our ear, we fervently
exclaimed (as again they died
away), in the words of their native
poet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“May He who stills the raven’s clamorous nest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And decks the lily fair in flow’ry pride,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, in the way his wisdom sees the best,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For them and for their little ones provide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But chiefly in their hearts with <em>grace divine</em> preside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such was the condition of a Highland
family in the autumn of 1845.
And now we are about to reverse
the picture; to show our Highland
family under other circumstances,
and we would entreat the reader to
remember that since the joyous and
the grievous, the bright days and
dark days, are alike of God’s appointment,
it must be good for us to look
upon both,—to look, to meditate, to
minister, and it may be, in so doing,
to learn a lesson that may be to <em>our</em>
profit as well as theirs. May God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
of his infinite mercy grant it, to the
glory of his holy name, through
Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>Eighteen months had passed over
the Highland cottage, and in their
brief course had swept away almost
all that it had once contained of the
appliances of domestic usefulness
and comfort; for the scarcity which
had been felt on the partial failure
of the potato crop in 1845, had, in
consequence of the <em>general</em> failure
of the following year, advanced
through the successive stages of privation
and destitution, till it might
now truly be said in the simple, but
emphatic language of Scripture, that
“the famine was sore in the land,”
for “<em>their food has been destroyed,</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and means of purchasing other food
they have not.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It is about the second week in
January, 1847, that we would again
introduce our friends to the home of
the M’Kenzies. An air of desolation
now reigned around it,—all was
still. There was no hum of children’s
voices making glad the lonely
glen; the fowls that had gathered
round the cottage-door were no longer
to be seen, the pig-stye was empty,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
the stream was frost-bound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>The thatch which had been secured
by birch twigs linked together in the
Highland fashion, and kept down by
a great stone suspended from the
twisted ends, and dangling in front,
was half off. The elder bush that
had grown beside the shed was gone,
and its hollow branches no longer
creaked in the wintry blast, for when
labour was scarce, and peat was
three times its usual price, any thing
that would serve for firing was little
likely to be spared. The interior
of the cottage offered a sad and
striking contrast to the scene of joy
and plenty it had presented before.</p>

<p>The table, formerly so hospitably
spread for us, was gone; the meal-chest,
the children’s bed, the comfortable
settle, each in its turn had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
been parted with for food; the
inner door was open, and there
were the bairns, no longer fresh,
rosy, full of life and vigour; they
had ceased to attend the school;
they had ceased to climb the overhanging
rocks, and splash and
dabble, like so many wild birds, in
the stream that foamed beneath the
ledge on which the cottage stood.
Poor children! they were all lying
huddled together on a mattress, with a
dirty blanket over it: their old pet the
grey cat curled up among the group.
They were scarcely covered, for the
one scanty, tattered garment which
did not reach the knees, showed
the deep poverty that had fallen on
the parents. They were anxiously
waiting for the hour when the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
portion of milk which the wretched
half, no, not half-fed cow, still
yielded, was to be divided among
them. It was now three days since
they had tasted any other nourishment,
and M’Kenzie and his wife
began to think it would be better to
sell or kill their cow, than thus to
see their little ones pining away
beneath the united pangs of cold
and hunger. But there had been
no fire upon the hearth that day;
for the few peats that remained
were husbanded to dress the meals
that they were daily hoping might,
through some providential channel,
come to them. And the children
awoke at night, crying with cold;
and one of them sobbed, and said,—“Collie
is always warm. Oh! mither,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
let me gang sleep wi’ Collie; for
Robin and Moggie are like the frost
to me.” The father spoke not! but
he went to the shed and led in the
poor miserable-looking cow, that
staggered from weakness as it
stepped over the stones at the door.
He brought it to the side of the
children’s bed, and, when it lay
down they stretched themselves
upon it, and the gentle creature,
that in happier days had been
caressed and often wreathed with
garlands of the broom and heather
by them, turned its head and fixed
its large mild eye upon them, as
though sensible of their sufferings,
and pleased to minister to them,
and for some hours suffering was
forgotten in sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The following morning word was
brought that there was work to be
had at ——, across the hills, and
that, perhaps, M’Kenzie might
be able to get some. He sighed
heavily, but he nodded assent, and,
bidding his wife get the Bible from
the shelf, and beckoning to the
children to come and stand around
him, he read the twenty-third Psalm,
and his voice became firm and clear
as he said,—“I shall not want,” for
he said it in David’s spirit, and he
believed it in his heart, and the
sense of his failing strength that
had clouded his brow, gave place
to the assurance of faith, as he read
the promise of the Staff that is
of power to support the weak.
And when he had prayed that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the might of the promise he might
go forth, he lifted the hymn as
usual; and it was a hymn of <em>praise</em>,
so that the passing stranger might
still have thought it went up from
light and happy hearts. And so,
indeed, it did; for how “shall the
righteous be made sad, whom I
have not made sad? saith the Lord
God.”</p>

<p>The morning worship over,
M’Kenzie started on his long and
toilsome walk. The embankment,
which was the scene of labour, was
full ten miles off, over moor and
mountain, but he got there after two
hours’ hard walking, and applied
for employment. He was received,
and at the end of the day was paid
<em>one shilling</em> for his toil; and he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
further ere he turned towards his
home, to spend his earnings in meal
for his family. It was late ere he
reached his cabin, his little ones
had cried themselves to sleep. His
wife, after watching long for his
return, oft turning to her sleeping
children in the sickness of hope
deferred, and then again straining
her eyes to look through the casement
for her husband, had seated
herself at the foot of the bed with
her hands clasped tightly together,
the indication of a strong mental
effort to repress the feelings of anxious
suspicion that were busy at her
heart, and thus M’Kenzie found
her. He shewed the bag of meal,
and told her that he had no doubt
of being employed at the embankment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
while the works were in
progress; but as he spoke, his words
became tremulous, his hand dropped,
and he would have fallen, if his wife
had not supported, and half dragged
him to the bed. Reader, you have
read in books of fancy and fiction,
scenes of <em>imaginary</em> faintings from
<em>imaginary</em> sources of emotion and
of suffering, and, perhaps, you have
wept at them; and for such <em>imaginary</em>
distresses, your tears were <em>enough</em>,
nay, all too much. They will <em>not</em>
suffice here. M’Kenzie had walked
ten miles to his labour. He had
honestly put forth all his strength
to his appointed task, he had made
a circuit of six miles to get the
oatmeal for his children ere he set
out on his homeward path. <span class="smcap">All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></span>
this he had done, and <em>he had not
tasted food that day</em>. His wife succeeded
so far in reviving him, that
he raised his head and looked
around, but he could not speak.
She looked for a sup of milk in the
earthen jar—their only remaining
vessel of any kind,—but it was
empty. The poor respited cow gave
what she could—a scanty supply, all
thin and watery! and unlike the
rich abundance she had formerly
yielded; still it was precious, and as
Margaret saw the colour stealing
over her husband’s wan face, she was
thankful that Collie had been spared.
If they could but manage to keep
her alive still, but the skin hung in
huge wrinkles over the projecting
bones, and except the dry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
withered bracken, fodder there was
none for her.</p>

<p>To kindle the few smouldering
peats that lay upon the hearth, and
to prepare a mess of porridge for
her husband, was Margaret’s next
care, but M’Kenzie protested that
he was abundantly refreshed already,
and that he was too sleepy to wait
for the cooking of the porridge.
Margaret urged him, but he would
not be persuaded, and they closed
the day with prayer and reading,
and together joined in praising Him
who had made good his promise of
the morning, and supplied their
need,—“I shall not <em>want</em>;” and as
they lay down on their heather
mattress with their little ones, all
sense of want was gone, and filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
with the consciousness of their
Heavenly Father’s presence with
them, and of his love towards them,
his everlasting love in Christ Jesus,
they slept in peace! Reader, what
would <em>they</em> have had to sustain their
fainting spirits if they had been
living without God in the world?</p>

<p>But morning came again, and
with it the cries of the little ones
for bread. The elder children tried
to hush them, but they had had
nothing except an occasional sip of
milk the day before, and their cries
were only to be stopped by food.
Margaret soon rose and prepared
the porridge, asking God’s blessing
on that which He had given. They
stood round and eat by turns, beginning
at the youngest save one, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
was an infant at the mother’s breast.
But when it came to M’Kenzie’s
turn, he shook his head, and looked
away. “Nae lassie, nae, I canna
eat the children’s bread,” he exclaimed.
But now the wife would
not be refused; “And what is your
strength but the children’s bread?”
she replied, “ah, man! ye maun
eat, or ye canna work; and neither
bit nor sup shall pass <em>my</em> lips till
ye hae eaten what’s there. I’ve
mair on the fire for the bairns, and
you’re wanting to be awa’, for its a
sair, sair bit, that ye hae to gang
till your work.”</p>

<p>“Dinna ca’ it <em>sair</em>, lassie, and I’ll do
as ye would hae me, for oh, its mony
and mony a braw Highlander that
looking on a family o’ hungry weans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
would bless God for the like, even
if the wage were less;” and he eat
up the porridge as he was bidden
(there might be a matter of a tea-cup
full).</p>

<p>Again the blessed book was read
aloud; again he led the prayer,
that was prayer indeed, for it arose
from a sense of actual want, and it
arose in the assurance that, through
the merits of the Redeemer, that
want, the temporal as well as the
spiritual, would be supplied. And
the thought of the mercies of yesterday
quickened his faith, and gave
animation to his voice as he raised
it in the hymn of praise: and then
he “went forth to his labour,” for
that was <em>his</em> part, and he felt strong
to do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>We will not prolong our history
by recording the details of days that
came and went in like manner: for
about three weeks the father continued
to work at the embankment,
returning to his family with the
fruits of his labour every evening.
But day by day his strength declined,
and on the fifth of February,
it was two hours past midnight
before he returned to his anxious
wife. He found her in earnest
prayer, and as he stepped over the
threshold, the words, “Lord, wilt
Thou leave us to perish, the mother
with the little ones?” fell on his
ear in accents wrung from an
agonized spirit. In the intenseness
of her supplication she had not
heard even <em>his</em> approach. Her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
which had been flung back was
suddenly bent forward, her hands
relaxed somewhat of the tightness
of their grasp, and the anguish
seemed to have passed away as she
fervently and firmly added,—“Yet
not <em>my</em> will, but <em>Thine</em> be done.”
It must be so indeed, for would our
gracious God have bidden us “cast
our burden upon him,” unless it had
been his purpose to receive it from
us?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Her eye now fell upon her
husband, and a strange chill crept
over her as she remarked his wild
and haggard look. Yes, the plague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
had begun! nature overtasked day
by day, could hold out no longer;
and though the spirit of the man
had sustained his infirmities, his
strength had failed at last. For
some days he had been struggling
with low fever, but he felt that he
could struggle no more, and that
the hand of death was upon him.
He looked round upon his wife and
children, but he remembered who
had said,—“Leave thy fatherless
children to Me, and let thy widows
trust in Me;” and he felt that in
exchanging the weak ministry of
his unnerved arm for the strength
of the “everlasting arms,” there
was no room for lamentation.</p>

<p>He tried to read the chapter as
usual, but his sight failed, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
lay back upon the clay floor, and
never rose from it again. The fever
rapidly assumed the worst form of
typhus, and ere the third day closed
in, Margaret M’Kenzie was a widow
indeed, and desolate. We will not
linger over details too painful to be
needlessly dwelt upon; we will not
unveil a sorrow too sacred to be exposed
and dissected; but we must
observe, that there is one feature
in the Highland character which
exercised a painful influence on the
poor family in this their hour of
deepest affliction. From the rareness
among them of such visitations,
any disorder of a contagious or
epidemic kind is regarded by the
Highlanders with such a degree of
horror as leads them to shrink from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
any offices involving contact with
the sufferers, and thus there was
none to help; and oh, who but
those who have known what it is to
feel the <em>loneliness</em> of sorrow, can
realize the strong consolation that
the M’Kenzies found in the assurance
of the sympathy of Christ,
and in the remembrance that of
him in his sufferings, it is written,—“Of
the people there was none with
me?”</p>

<p>The elder boy had been sent to
the nearest place to procure a coffin,
and to promise the cow in payment,—it
was their only remaining possession,
except the heather mattress,
and <em>that</em> none would take, from
dread of the fever,—and Margaret’s
wedding gown, which her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
had tried to exchange for money or
for food; but no one had either to
give for it.</p>

<p>When the carpenter heard the
boy’s name, he shrunk back, and
bade him be gone, in a voice in
which terror predominated over sympathy.</p>

<p>In due time, however, the coffin
was brought to the door, and there
deposited; and of the few clansmen
who attended to bear their kinsman
to the grave, not one would enter
the dwelling to assist in moving the
remains of him to whom living or
dying, under any other circumstances,
they would have refused nothing.
Poor Margaret! that <em>was</em> a trial!
but not greater than the promise,—“<em>As</em>
thy day, so shall thy strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
be.” It was indeed a dark, dark
day; but the promise <em>could</em> not be
hidden, even though it was a darkness
to be <em>felt</em>. <em>How</em> it was accomplished,
the poor widow knew not.
The first-born had helped, and fallen
panting at the threshold, fainting
with exertion and with horror; and
when the door was opened, those
without drew back, and bade her,
though in tones of solemn pity, lay
her burden in its narrow bed herself;
and then they signed to her
to retire. She closed the door behind
her, and in a few minutes they
drew round the coffin, closed, and
bore it to the boat, and rowed in
silence to the island resting-place of
the M’Kenzies, in the middle of the
lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>There is something peculiarly solemn
in standing on an island of
graves. The very dust that the
summer breeze wafts over us, may
indeed remind us of our mortality,—suggest
a thought that it, perhaps,
was once animated: but the complete
isolation of such a spot as this,
fixes the mind to the contemplation,
as though thought for once were
fettered, and the subject of her
meditations were bound upon her,
like the wave upon that sepulchral
shore,—and so it was felt by all
now, and not a word was spoken as
they laid M’Kenzie in his long
home.</p>

<p>But we must return to the cabin
where the roof-tree had thus fallen
in its prime, and where yet, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
faith and hope that is in Christ
Jesus, the widow was enabled, amid
the desolation of all things earthly,
still to bear up, and amid her first
tears, to thank God that her husband
had departed in peace. The delirium
had ceased about an hour before his
death, and he had bade his Margaret
remember that, though while spared
to his family they had a right to
look to him for support, yet he had
been but the instrument, in God’s
hands, for providing it; and that
now he was taken from them, God
would be sure to supply their necessities
through some other channel,
rather than be wanting to his promise
of being a “husband to the
widow, and a father to the fatherless.”
He bade her read him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
eighth chapter of Romans, “that
blessed chapter,” he said, “which
begins with no condemnation and
ends with no separation.” When
she came to the words “killed all
the day long—accounted as sheep
for the slaughter,” he fixed his eyes
upon her; and as she read on, “in
all these things we are more than
conquerors through him who loved
us,” he repeated after her “more
than conquerors through Him,”
“<em>more</em> than conquerors.” And as
she read further, “I am persuaded
that neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature, shall be able
to separate us from the love of God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
which is in Christ Jesus,” he
bowed his head as if in experimental
assent, and his spirit departed to
God who gave it.</p>

<p>Such had been M’Kenzie’s end;
and his widow as she thought of
his freed spirit rejoicing before the
Throne and with the Lamb, was
comforted, and found peace in the
expectation of the time when she
and his little ones should also be
summoned to that land where “they
neither hunger nor thirst any more.”</p>

<p>That night she read the latter
part of the seventh chapter of the
Revelation with her children; and
as she told how their father was
now among this “great multitude,”
little Moggie cried, and asked as
she shivered with the cold, why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
they might not go to him; for “O
mither, though ye hae read that
there’s nae heat there, onie mair
than here, yet gin there’s nae hunger,
it wadna be sae sair to bear.”</p>

<p>The tears fell fast from Margaret’s
eyes, the first tears she had shed,
as she took the child upon her knee,
and told her that none could enter
that land, but those whom God was
pleased to call there, and that till
he gave the summons we must
patiently abide here, suffering his
will, and enduring unto the end
whatever he sees fit. “And oh,
Moggie, lass,” she added, “ye ken I
bless God ye hae aye kennit, since
ye were auld enoo’ to understand,
‘that our Heavenly Father so loved
the world that he gave his only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Son to die for us;’ ‘and now shall
he not with him also freely give us
<em>all</em> things?’ And as he gives hunger
and cold to us now, it’s because
they’re best for us, for he <em>could</em> give
food and firing just as easily. And
oh, my dear bairns, doesna’ it soften
your pangs to think that your Father
in Heaven sends them?”</p>

<p>Moggie put her arm round her
mother’s neck and nodded assent
and tried to smile, but the shivering
that had seized her was the beginning
of the fever, and she too drooped
and died. Margaret told her that
the summons <em>had</em> now come for
her, and she asked her if she would
like to go to the Lord Jesus, the
good shepherd who had said, “Suffer
the little children to come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
me?” The child could not speak,
but she stretched her arms upward,
and ere they fell again at her side,
she knew what it was to be gathered
among the lambs of the heavenly
pasture; she knew (oh, may we all
one day know too), <em>what it is</em> to
“be with Jesus.”</p>

<p>The little stock of meal that the
clansmen had brought with them
on the day of M’Kenzie’s funeral,
was now exhausted; the cow had
ceased to yield any milk, and would
have been killed for food, but none
had strength to deal the fatal
blow. The extremity of destitution
had now come upon the bereaved
family. The poor infant sought
in vain for the nourishment that was
no longer supplied, and cried and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
mourned upon its mother’s knees.
The two elder boys were down with
the fever, but they struggled hard
with it, <em>their</em> summons was not
sounded yet.</p>

<p>And do you ask <em>how</em> Margaret
and her children were supported?
She shall answer for herself. “We
lived upon the promises of God’s
Word, and when they seemed to
tarry, we just read the fourth of
Philippians, and so were enabled
to wait, though they tarry, through
Christ that strengtheneth us in the
spirit.”</p>

<p>Oh, the blessings of a <em>Bible</em> education;
if those who undervalue, or
would substitute something else in
its stead, could just contrast the
peace of a Highland family, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the despair of an Irish cabin, where
the Scriptures are unknown, and
the way of salvation is hidden from
their eyes; they would surely be
content to give the Scriptures, at
all events, to those to whom they
can secure no earthly good beside.
And may those who <em>have</em> the Scriptures
and have <em>with</em> them the good
things of this life, learn to prize
them the more highly, when they
see those who have received them
into their hearts and minds, “thankful
and contented amid the horrors of
starvation.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But we digress,—two days had
come and gone without food of any
kind, and as she had no breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to give them, Margaret had let her
children sleep late in the morning;
and when, ere she lay down at
night by their side, she had looked
on their pale wan faces, the skin
prematurely shrivelled and wrinkled,
the bones projecting in place of the
dimpled roundness of childhood,
she felt that their hours must be
numbered, and often instead of
sleeping, she rose and put her ear
close to each, that she might be sure
they still breathed. And she shrunk
overpowered from the thought of
passing another night thus; and
then the weary day that followed—deserted
by all, not a living thing
came near the dwelling. Still strong
in faith, Margaret cheered her remaining
little ones till evening came, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
they asked her to pray that they might
go to their father and Moggie. She
asked if they would leave her then
alone? they said she should ask to
go too. And then the second girl
Jeanie asked why, if God heard
prayer, he had not heard theirs and
given them bread? It is written,
“He giveth not account of any
of his matters,” said the mother
solemnly. “It is written, too, ‘He
doth not <em>willingly</em> afflict the children
of men,’ and (in pity to the weakness
of our faith, and as if to meet
the very cravings of our questioning),
it is most graciously written also,
‘What I do thou knowest not now,
but thou <em>shalt</em> know hereafter.’”
This was said, as is generally the
case with the Scotch in speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
directly of Scripture, in the pure
English of the authorized version;
it was also said, in a tone of rebuke,
for perhaps nothing could have
excited her feelings so deeply as the
idea of unbelief of God’s Word, or
distrust of God’s love in any of her
children. It was as though the enemy
had found entrance; as though the
wolf, seeking whom he might devour,
had got into her little fold. She
took the child on her knee, “Jeanie,
lass,” she said, “It is nae sae lang
syne that you should forget the day
your father corrected ye and kept
you withouten yer parritch for dinner
or supper, because ye’d displeased
and disobeyed him; and did ye
think <em>then</em> either that he <em>could na’</em>
have bidden me gie ye the parritch;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
or that he had nae gude reason for
not bidding me. Ye thinkit nae
siccan a thing, Jeanie, and ye maun
ken that your Heavenly Father has
a right to chasten ye, as well as your
earthly, and ye maun <em>feel</em> as well
as <em>ken</em> that he does it for your
profit.” The little girl leant her
head against her mother’s shoulder
and wept; and Margaret kissed her,
and continued soothingly,—“I dinna
expect ye to find it pleasant, lass,
‘for no chastening for the present
seemeth to be joyous, but grievous.’
And this is grievous above measure,
in especial for weans like ye; but
remember we ‘do not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of the
Lord.’ And pray, pray to him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
forgive you the thought of your
heart, and to make you ‘trust him,
though you canna trace him;’ he
says, ‘I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee.’ You saw that
he was with your father and Moggie,
yet they died, but He was with them
as the life of their spirit, and now
they are with Him for ever.” The
child, soothed by her voice and
warmed by her embrace, ere long
fell asleep in her arms; and thus
Margaret passed the dreaded night.
She would not move for fear of
breaking the deep, sound sleep; but
the presence of her God was with
her, and none of the terrors of
darkness were suffered to approach
her.</p>

<p>The morning dawn showed Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
her other children stretched
on their mattress as usual; but the
grey cat, their constant companion
had disappeared. Stiff and weary,
the mother laid herself down by
them and fell asleep; and the day
was far advanced when she again
opened her eyes on the scene of
so much suffering. The fever had
not attacked the others; and the
boys who had had it, were recovering,
though so weak that without nourishment
as they were, it was plain they
could not long survive. The baby
seldom unclosed its eyes, it lay
and slumbered either on its mother’s
lap, or on a bundle of rags in a
corner of the room. The rest had
become too weak to cry, too faint
to talk, and except when the chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
was read, and the prayer arose,
or when Margaret repeated aloud
some promise from God’s Word to
support the hearts of her little
ones, silence reigned in the cottage.
Exhaustion produced drowsiness,
and quieted the pangs of hunger.
The hope of procuring food had
almost deserted her; the only dwelling
within two miles, was a solitary
cabin, whose tenants were little
likely to be better provided than
herself; and Margaret felt that she
had now only to wait in patience,
till He who hath the keys of death,
should open the portals of the
shadowy valley and lead them all
through it, to the mansions prepared
for them above. Her own
strength was wonderful; it could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
not be natural strength, for that
had been drained by her infant,
and by long abstinence and painful
watching; it was the strength of
woman’s devotedness, upheld by faith
in the Word of God.</p>

<p>She led the morning worship
as usual, and she prayed in calm
resignation that she might be
enabled to submit her will with
cheerfulness to the will of God; and
she praised the loving Saviour for
his gracious assurance, in his invitation
to the little children, that he
would receive them. To Him in
death, as she believed, she now
committed them; but the thought,
that she had not yet fully done <em>her</em>
part, sunk upon her conscience; and
giving the baby into the charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
the elder ones, she bade them pray
that God would guide her way
while she went in search of food
to keep them all alive. But she
had overtasked her powers, and
as she met the current of fresh,
cold air, her head swam, her steps
tottered, and she fell as she crossed
the threshold. And it was a shriek
of ecstasy such as she little thought
her famishing bairns could have
raised, such as for many a day, many
a week had never fallen on her ears
that roused her again to consciousness.
She rose, and supporting
herself by the wall, re-entered the
room. And oh, what a sight met
her eyes, there was the grey cat
with a large fish in its mouth upon
the children’s bed. He who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
formerly fed his prophet by the
ravens, had now in this affecting
providence shown his care of them.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The fish was brought as one of the
boys suggested, from an old <em>yare</em>,
or fish trap at the head of the lake.
Hunger had overcome the instinctive
dislike of the cat to water, and the
instinct which leads the species to
play with its prey before despatching
it, had thus been overruled for the
sustenance of his people, by him
“who ordereth <em>all</em> things.”</p>

<p>The cat dropped the fish between
the children, and purring and rubbing
herself against them, jumped
down, and made her way through
the opened door. She returned
with a second supply, and for three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
days the family were kept alive in
this manner. If Margaret’s faith
had been firm and unwavering
before, we need not wonder that
now all care for the future seemed
taken from her heart. God had
begun to restore, he would not mock
her hopes; and the desire of life and
the thought of better, no not better
(for never had she lived so near her
God), but brighter days revived. It
was at this time that the deputation
from the Destitution Committee arrived
in Argyleshire. They visited
the glen, and awarded to Margaret,
in common with about 120 of the
most destitute families, an allowance
of meal, sufficient for the support
of herself and her family for six
weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>And now we would, ere we part,
say a few last words to the reader.
Have you as you read felt moved
by the tale of suffering, such as
perhaps you never even imagined
before? Then if you have, let the
feeling <em>work</em>; for it has been well
said, “When such relations in real
life are listened to, without any
efforts for the relief of the sufferer,
the emotion is gradually weakened;”
and that moral condition, “so abhorrent
to our fellow creatures, so alien
from the Divine Nature, is produced,
which we call selfishness and hardness
of heart.” And we might appeal
even to this very selfishness; for
that which is the case of our brethren
now, may ere long be our own. We
trust that through the sparing mercy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of our God, and his blessing on our
harvests, sought by our humiliation
through the merits of the Redeemer,
it may be averted from us. But
“<em>as</em>” in such a case, <em>should</em> it ever be
your own, “ye would that men
should do unto you, <em>even so</em> do unto
them.” “To-day harden not your
hearts.”</p>

<p>The Highlander too has a peculiar
claim on our bounty, for he has ever
been ready to minister to the wants
of the stranger and the traveller.
During a tour of some weeks among
the mountains and the glens, we
very frequently closed an evening
ramble by a visit to their cottages.
And never in one single instance,
though we were a party of five, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
we allowed to depart without partaking
of their hospitality; nor

return. Their hospitality they can
no longer offer, their meal chest is
empty, their cow has long been gone,
and is it not the time for us to render
back what we so freely received?
But they have a <em>higher</em> claim. It is
written,—“Do good unto all men,

household of faith</em>,” and such are
they.</p>

<p>“And oh, may we all have grace
so to deny ourselves that we may be
enabled to follow the example of His
compassion, Who, ‘though He was
rich, yet for our sakes became poor.’
And Who, though content for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
sakes to endure himself the pinching
pains of hunger and want, yet
suffered not the multitudes to go
hungry away.”</p>

<p>“This work, dedicated to the Chevalier Bunsen, cannot fail to be
read with great interest, and more especially at a time when many
eyes are directed to ‘the holy city,’ when, it is to be hoped, a growing
anxiety is felt for the spiritual welfare of Israel. We have laid before
our readers the commencement of a series of letters from our excellent
friend Mr. Veitch, for a season the fellow-labourer with Mr.
Ewald in the East; and we think that correspondence will fully bear
out the accuracy of Mr. Ewald’s statements, and bear full testimony
to his zeal, devotedness, and energy to the work of his Divine Master.

with an approach to jealousy; let those who thus view it read the

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
